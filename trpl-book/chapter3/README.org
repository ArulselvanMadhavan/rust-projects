* Programming Concepts
** Variables and Constants
   - Constants are always immutable and must annotated with a type.
   - Constants can be declared in any scope, including global scope.
   - Variables can be shadowed using the ~let~ keyword.
   - Shadowing is mostly used to allow transformations on a value.
