* A Tour of Rust
** Macros
   - Macros end with ~!~
   - Example: ~assert!~, ~println!~
   - Some macros are removed when the program is compiled for speed.
     - For example: ~debug_assert!~, ~println!~
** Attributes
   - Attributes are an open-ended system for marking functions and
     other declarations with extra information.
   - Used to control compiler warnings, code style checks, include
     code conditionally, tell Rust how to interact with code written
     in other languages.
   - Example: ~#[test]~ skipped from compilation of source.
